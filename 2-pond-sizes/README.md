Pond Sizes
============

    You have an integer matrix representing a plot of land, where the
    value at that location represents the height above sea level.
    A value of 0 indicates water. A pond is a region of water connected
    vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
    The size of the pond is the total number of connected water cells.
    
    Write a method to compute the sizes of all the ponds in the matrix.
    
    Example:
    
    Input:
    
       0 2 1 0
       0 1 0 1
       1 1 0 1
       0 1 0 1
    
    Output:
    
       1, 2, 4
